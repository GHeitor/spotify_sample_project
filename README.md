# Guided Data Engineering Projects
1. [Spotify ETL using Python andÂ AWS](https://github.com/kxnk/de-guided-proj/tree/main/1.%20Spotify%20Pipeline)
* Objective: Develop an ETL pipeline using Python and AWS services to obtain the artist, album, and song information from the "Discover Weekly" playlist on Spotify. This playlist is updated every Monday and consists of 30 personalized songs tailored for each user. The pipeline involves extracting data from the Spotify API, transforming the data to prepare it for analysis, loading the transformed data into Amazon S3, and querying the transformed data using Amazon Athena, utilizing AWS Glue for cataloging and metadata management.
* Tools used: Python, AWS services (CloudWatch, Lambda, S3, Glue and Athena)
